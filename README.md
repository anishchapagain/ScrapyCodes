Earthquake: Nepal 2015 (Past and April-Gorkha Aftershocks)
----------------------------------------------------------
Here, I’ve tried using Python Data Analysis Library ‘Pandas’ for learning purpose and exploring a bit of its scope that can be handy     in any case using most of common tools and learning ‘pandas’ side-by-side.’pandas’ is really a great tool with easy functions and        large options set for almost all facility it provides. 

I suggest, using Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution for its large python library, and easy to use console,command,editor with ‘Spyder’..Easy Analysis and Visualisation, reading/writing of DataSets is ‘pandas’ great outcomes. Data for Earthquake (Gorkha Aftershocks) have been scraped from Seismonepal. Thank’s for them for updating the site in regular quake attacks,......
